The Clausewitz Color Factory generates unused color values that modders can use to modify 
or create Hearts of Iron 4, Europa Universalis 4, or (maybe) Stellaris maps.

HOW TO USE:

1. Open executable.
2. Enter desired number of colors to create (between 1 and 50,000).
3. Enter minimum contrast between colors (useful for the colorblind/people who want easily distinguishable provinces).
4. Enter values to clamp the RGB channels (useful if you want to make everything a uniform tint [e.g. for sea zones in HoI 4]).
5. Determine whether to sort colors by brightness. (This will bloat the generation time significantly. 
						    I suggest generating less than 2000 colors at a time if selecting this option.)

The program will generate a text file containing a list of free RGB and hex values 
as well as a bmp file displaying the colors.
